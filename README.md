# RedditSuicideWatch

Social media has popularized the anonymous sharing of thoughts and users can use these platforms to talk about their problems and ask for help. On the SuicideWatch subreddit, users who are struggling with suicidal thoughts can find support from peers. Although forums like SuicideWatch may not always exist or be accessible on social media platforms, user posts can provide insight into whether they are at high risk of suicidality. To help identify users who are at high risk for suicidality, we have created a semi-supervised learning approach that uses user Reddit posts to classify their risk of suicidality. Our approach uses a DistilBERT base model and sentiment features from pre-trained sentiment analysis model (See https://huggingface.co/bhadresh-savani/distilbert-base-uncased-emotion for the model and see https://huggingface.co/datasets/dair-ai/emotion for the dataset). This approach achieves an F1 score of 0.79 on identifying users for their risk of suicidality.
